	<br>
	<p>You continue to be who you are but I can never understand you. The way you bend and shape as you glide over me is truly special. I ask, will you turn with me? Can you help me understand who I am, or do you care of what happened to me. It is because of you that I can’t turn the pages in my mind to move on.</p>
