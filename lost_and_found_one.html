	<h1>Lost and Found #1  - Face to Face  - September 12th 2014</h1>
	<p>From my memory while standing facing you, I feel like a fool. I question you and I wonder about you and in the other hand my love for you runs deep. So when I see you, I greet you.  Under daylight you seem clear, you seem true, but again I wonder how can I reach the liberating essence of you, how can I breath you, and become a part of you. The question still remains as fear whispers in my ears. </p>
