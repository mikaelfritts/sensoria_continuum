	<h1>Lost and Found #3 - One Step – November 5th 2014</h1>
	<p>I feel good. I feel like trusting. I feel like discovering. I feel like exploring what you have to offer. I want to see whom you really are and if you’re the same at night. People tell me to stay away, “don’t go out at night,” but I feel I can trust you. My friends are here. So I think I can, I think I can. With each step, one step. </p>
