	<h1>Lost and Found #4 – A Moment of Clarity - December 10th 2014</h1>
	<p>You are cold. You are harsh. You are unforgettable, you are, you are. I wonder sometimes are you truly apart of this world in a way the dusk forms the earth. My faith sometimes in this experience is sometimes questioned. Each time I see a touch of hope, a flash of stillness comes over me and freezes me in my tracks. I’m scared, I am scared, there, I said it. I try each and every day to see further. To go beyond to swim to be a better man, but my weakness shows. Can I trust this? Can I trust you? Is there a God? As you turn and move, you grow. I want to grow, move forward and shape myself to become better. What do I do? I think this is a time I walk away as you rise towards me. Should I walk away or stand firm to feel you crash into me. Or be still and let go. I think it is you that make me want to discover myself, somehow, someway. </p>
